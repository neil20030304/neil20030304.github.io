I'm currently a senior undergraduate student at William and Mary. I double major in Computer science and applied mathematics. I'm interested in machine learning across different applications, particularly smart health care and autonomous driving. Currently I'm working on tremor detection for Parkinson's disease using domain adaptation under supervision of Dr. Gang Zhou.
